#  This program is a work in progress and it changes on daily basis due to new features      #
#  being implemented, changes being made to already implemented features, bug fixes, etc.    #
#  Therefore if the current version is not working as expected try to clone it again the     #
#  next day or shoot me an email describing the problem. Any input is appreciated. Also      #
#  keep in mind that some features may be implemented only partially (as needed for stack    #
#  operation) or they may be implemented in sub-optimal or not 100% RFC compliant way (due   #
#  to lack of time) or last but not least they may contain bug(s) that i didn't notice yet.  #
#                                                                                            #
