# PyTCP ver. 2.7

PyTCP is a fully functional TCP/IP stack written in Python. It supports TCP stream-based transport with reliable packet delivery based on a sliding window mechanism and basic congestion control. It also supports IPv6/ICMPv6 protocols with SLAAC address configuration. It operates as a user space program attached to the Linux TAP interface. Today, the stack can send and receive traffic over the Internet using IPv4 and IPv6 default gateways for routing. 

Version 2.7, unlike its predecessors, contains the PyTCP stack code as a library so that it can be easily imported and used in external code. This should make the user experience smoother and eventually provide the full ability to replace the standard Linux stack calls (e.g., socket library) with the PyTcp calls in any 3rd party application.

This program is a work in progress, and it often changes due to new features being implemented, changes being made to implement features, bug fixes, etc. Therefore, if the current version is not working as expected, try to clone it again the next day or email me the problem. Any input is appreciated. Also, remember that some stack features may be implemented only partially (as needed for stack operation). They may be implemented in a sub-optimal fashion or not 100% RFC-compliant way (due to lack of time), or they may contain bug(s) that I still need to fix.

Please feel free to check my two other related projects:
 - [RusTCP](https://github.com/ccie18643/RusTCP) - Attempt to rewrite some of PyTCP funcionality in Rust and use it to create IPv6/SRv6 lab router.
 - [SeaTCP](https://github.com/ccie18643/SeaTCP) - Attempt to create low latency stack using C and Assembly languages.

#### IPv6 Neighbor Discovery / Duplicate Address Detection / Address Auto Configuration
 - stack tries to auto configure it's link local address, it generates it as EUI64 address, as part od DAD process it joins appropriate solicited node multicast group and sends neighbor solicitation for the address it generated
 - stack doesn't receive any Neighbor Advertisement for the address it generated so assigns it to its interface
 - stack tries to assign preconfigured static address, as part of DAD process it joins appropriate solicited node multicast group and sends neighbor solicitation for the static address
 - another host that has the same address already assigned replies with Neighbor Advertisement message, this tells the stack that the address its trying to assign has been already
y assigned by another host so stack cannot us it
 - stack sends out Router Solicitation message to check if there are any global prefixes it should use
 - router responds with Router Advertisement containing additional prefix
 - stack tries to assign address generated based on received prefix and EUI64 host portion, as part of DAD process it joins appropriate solicited node multicast group and sends neighbor solicitation for the static address
 - stack doesn't receive any Neighbor Advertisement for the address it generated so assigns it to its interface
 - after all addresses are assigned stacks sends out one more Multicast Listener report listing all of the multicast addresses it wants to listen to

#### TCP Fast Retransmit in action after lost TX packet
 - outgoing packet is 'lost' as result of simulated packet loss mechanism
 - peer notices the inconsistence in packet SEQ numbers and sends out 'fast retransmit request'
 - stack eceives the request and retransmits lost packet

#### Out of order queue in action during RX packet loss event
 - incoming packet is 'lost' as reult of simulated packet loss mechanism
 - stack notices that there is an inconsistence in inbound packet's SEQ number and sends out 'fast retransmit' request
 - before peer receives the request it already sends multiple packets with higher SEQ than what stack is expecting, stack queues all those packets
 - peer retransmits lost packet
 - stack receives lost packet, pulls all the packets stored in ooo queue so far and processes them
 - stacks sends out ACK packet to acknowledge latest of the packets pulled from queue

#### TCP Finite State Machine - stack is running TCP Echo service
 - peer opens connection
 - peer sends data
 - stack echoes the data back
 - peer closes connection

 - second screenshot shows stack with sanity check turned on, malformed ICMPv6 packet is being discarded before being passed to ICMPv6 protocol parser
 - third screenshot shows the malformed packet, number of MA records field has been set to 777 despite packet contains only one record

#### ARP Probe/Announcement mechanism
 - stack is using ARP Probes to find any possible conflicts for every IP address that has been configured
 - one of IP addresses (192.168.9.102) is already taken so stack gets notified about it and skips it
 - rest of IP addresses are free so stack claims them by sending ARP Announcement for each of them

#### ARP resolution and handling ping packets
 - host 192.168.9.20 tries to ping the stack, to be able to do it it first sends ARP Request packet to find out stack's MAC address
 - stack responds by sending ARP Reply packet (stack doesn't need to send out its own request since it already made note of the host's MAC from host's request)
 - hosts sends ping packets, stack responds to them

#### IP fragmentation
 - host sends 4Kb UDP datagram using three fragmented IP packet (three fragments) 
 - stack receives packets and assembles them into single piece, then passes it (via UDP protocol handler and UDP Socket) to UDO Echo service
 - UDP Echo service picks data up and puts it back into UDP Socket
 - UDP datagram is being passed to IP protocol handler which creates IP packet and after checking that it exceedes link MTU fragments it into three separate IP packets
 - IP packets are being encapsulated in Ethernet frames and put on TX ring
