This document records the PyTCP codebase's adherence to RFC 3168
for the **IP-layer portions** (the ECN codepoints on the IP
wire, the reassembly CE preservation rule). TCP-specific ECN
mechanics (ECE / CWR flags, ECN negotiation in SYN/SYN-ACK,
sender / receiver reactions) are out of scope here and audited
in the TCP RFC adherence records under `docs/rfc/tcp/`.

The audit was performed by reading the RFC text fresh and
inspecting `packages/net_proto/net_proto/protocols/ip4/ip4__header.py`,
`packages/pytcp/pytcp/runtime/packet_handler/packet_handler__ip4__rx.py`, and
`packages/pytcp/pytcp/protocols/ip/ip_frag_table.py` directly. Non-normative
content (§1 Introduction, §2 Conventions, §3 Assumptions, §4
AQM background, §10-§22) is omitted.

## Top-line adherence

PyTCP **meets** the IP-layer §5 normative requirements: the
2-bit ECN field is correctly carried on every TX/RX path, and
reassembly aggregates ECN across fragments per §5.3 (CE
propagates when no fragment is Not-ECT; mixed Not-ECT+other
yields a drop, matching Linux behaviour).

| Section | Topic                                                | Status |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| §5      | ECN field structure (Not-ECT / ECT(0) / ECT(1) / CE) | met (wire codec) |
| §5      | CE codepoint MUST trigger congestion-control reaction | met (TCP side; see TCP audits) |
| §5.1    | Single CE = persistent congestion semantics          | met (transport-layer concern) |
| §5.2    | Dropped/corrupted ECN packets                        | n/a (host-layer only sees received packets) |
| §5.3    | Reassembly preserves CE across fragments             | met (shipped) |
| §6.1    | TCP-specific ECN mechanics                           | covered by TCP audits |
| §7      | Non-compliance by end nodes (sender/receiver lying)  | met (we honour CE on RX, we don't suppress on TX) |
| §8      | Non-compliance in network (CE erasure)               | n/a (router-side concern) |
| §9      | Encapsulated packets (IP-in-IP)                      | n/a (not implemented) |

## §5 ECN Field in IP

> "Bits 6 and 7 in the IPv4 TOS octet are designated as the ECN
> field."

**Adherence:** met. `Ip4Header.ecn: int` is the 2-bit field at
the low-order end of the TOS byte
(`packages/net_proto/net_proto/protocols/ip4/ip4__header.py:99,129`). Pack/unpack
preserve the bit positions
(`ip4__header.py:182,218`).

> "ECT(0) codepoint is '10', ECT(1) codepoint is '01', CE
> codepoint is '11', Not-ECT codepoint is '00'."

**Adherence:** met. The field is unstructured at the IP layer
— any of the four codepoints is accepted on receive and
preserved on send. The TX entry point exposes
`ip4__ecn: int = 0` as a kwarg
(`packages/pytcp/pytcp/runtime/packet_handler/packet_handler__ip4__tx.py:101`)
so callers can set ECT(0) or ECT(1) on outbound packets; the
RX parser surfaces the received value as
`packet_rx.ip4.ecn`.

> "Routers treat the ECT(0) and ECT(1) codepoints as
> equivalent."

**Adherence:** n/a (PyTCP is a host stack, not a router). The
host treats the field as an opaque preserved-on-wire value.

> "Upon the receipt by an ECN-Capable transport of a single
> CE packet, the congestion control algorithms followed at the
> end-systems MUST be essentially the same as the congestion
> control response to a *single* dropped packet."

**Adherence:** met (transport-layer side). The IP layer passes
the ECN field up to TCP via `packet_rx.ip4.ecn`; TCP records
the codepoint on the per-segment metadata and feeds it into
the AccECN / classic-ECN state machine. Cross-references:
`docs/rfc/tcp/` for the TCP ECN mechanics.

## §5.3 Fragmentation

> "ECN-capable packets MAY have the DF (Don't Fragment) bit set.
> Reassembly of a fragmented packet MUST NOT lose indications
> of congestion. In other words, if any fragment of an IP
> packet to be reassembled has the CE codepoint set, then one
> of two actions MUST be taken:
> * Set the CE codepoint on the reassembled packet. However,
>   this MUST NOT occur if any of the other fragments
>   contributing to this reassembly carries the Not-ECT
>   codepoint.
> * The packet is dropped, instead of being reassembled."

**Adherence:** **met (shipped).** The shared reassembly
machinery in `packages/pytcp/pytcp/protocols/ip/ip_frag.py` +
`ip_frag_table.py` retains per-fragment ECN in
`IpFragData.ecn: dict[int, int]` and aggregates at completion
via `aggregate_ecn()`. The aggregation table follows Linux
`net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c::ip_frag_ecn_table[]`:

- All fragments same codepoint → that codepoint preserved.
- CE + ECT(0) / ECT(1) / both → CE (CE propagation).
- ECT(0) + ECT(1) → ECT(0).
- Any mix containing Not-ECT alongside any other codepoint →
  `IpFragAddOutcome.ECN_MIXED__DROP` (the §5.3 second branch);
  the IPv4 RX handler bumps `ip4__frag__ecn_mixed__drop` and
  drops the packet.

The IPv4 RX handler at `packet_handler__ip4__rx.py:409-413`
patches byte 1 of the reassembled header with the aggregated
ECN (DSCP preserved from first fragment):

```python
header[1] = (header[1] & 0xFC) | (result.ecn & 0x03)
```

The same aggregation applies to IPv6 reassembly via
`packet_handler__ip6_frag__rx.py` (where ECN lives in byte 1
bits 5-4 of the Traffic Class field).

## §6.1 TCP — ECN negotiation, ECE / CWR, sender/receiver mechanics

**Adherence:** covered separately by the TCP RFC adherence
records. The IP-layer audit here only asserts that ECN bits
are passed up to TCP intact (`packet_rx.ip4.ecn` exposed on
the parser) and that outbound TCP segments can request
specific ECN codepoints via the `ip4__ecn` kwarg through to
`Ip4Assembler`.

## §7 Non-compliance by End Nodes

> "End nodes that are sending non-ECN-capable IP packets MUST
> set the ECN field to '00' (Not-ECT)."

**Adherence:** met. The default for `ip4__ecn` is 0
(`packet_handler__ip4__tx.py:101`,
`ip4__assembler.py:68`) — every outbound packet is Not-ECT
unless an ECN-aware transport explicitly sets ECT(0) or
ECT(1).

## §8 Non-compliance in the Network (CE erasure)

**Adherence:** n/a — router-side concern. PyTCP does not
forward; the RX path preserves the received ECN value into
`packet_rx.ip4.ecn` and the upper layer decides what to do.

## §9 Encapsulated Packets (IP-in-IP)

**Adherence:** not implemented. PyTCP does not implement IP-in-IP
tunnelling (RFC 2003 / RFC 4380). When tunnel support lands,
this section's ECN-tunnel rules (limited-functionality vs.
full-functionality decapsulation) become relevant.

## Test coverage audit

### §5 ECN field wire codec

- **Unit:**
  `packages/net_proto/net_proto/tests/unit/protocols/ip4/test__ip4__header__asserts.py`
  Boundary assert on `ecn` field (uint2: 0-3).
- **Unit:**
  `packages/net_proto/net_proto/tests/unit/protocols/ip4/test__ip4__parser__operation.py`
  Round-trip matrix exercises all 4 ECN codepoints.
- **Unit:**
  `packages/net_proto/net_proto/tests/unit/protocols/ip4/test__ip4__assembler__operation.py`
  Assembler round-trip across ECN values.

**Status:** locked in.

### §5 ECN bit propagation up to TCP

- **Integration:** TCP integration suite includes ECN-
  negotiation cases that exercise the `packet_rx.ip4.ecn`
  read path. See `docs/rfc/tcp/` for the TCP-side audits.

**Status:** locked in via TCP audits.

### §5 Default ECN=00 (Not-ECT) on send

- **Integration:**
  `packages/pytcp/pytcp/tests/integration/protocols/<proto>/test__<proto>__ip4__tx.py`
  Default cases ship with `ecn=0`. The TCP-side ECN
  negotiation tests override to ECT(0).

**Status:** locked in.

### §5.3 Reassembly preserves CE

- **Unit:**
  `packages/pytcp/pytcp/tests/unit/protocols/ip/test__ip__ip_frag.py::TestAggregateEcn`
  13 cases covering every Linux-table state — all-same
  preservation, CE propagation with each ECT variant,
  ECT(0)+ECT(1) → ECT(0), every Not-ECT mixed-with-other drop
  path, single-fragment passthrough.
- **Unit:**
  `packages/pytcp/pytcp/tests/unit/protocols/ip/test__ip__ip_frag_table.py::TestIpFragTableEcnAggregation`
  7 cases end-to-end through `IpFragTable.add_fragment`:
  atomic-fragment pass-through, same-ECN preserved, CE
  propagation, ECT(0)+ECT(1)→ECT(0), CE+Not-ECT drop,
  ECT+Not-ECT drop, default ecn=0 backwards-compat.
- **Integration:**
  `packages/pytcp/pytcp/tests/integration/protocols/ip4/test__ip4__rx.py::TestIp4RxRfc3168EcnAggregationOnReassembly`
  5 wire-level cases driving two-fragment flows into
  `_phrx_ethernet` and inspecting the reassembled datagram on
  the wire: same-ECN propagates the codepoint, CE+ECT(0)
  aggregates to CE in the response's TOS byte, ECT(0)+ECT(1)
  collapses to ECT(0); Not-ECT+ECT and Not-ECT+CE flows are
  silently dropped (no ICMP response emitted) and the
  `ip4__frag__ecn_mixed__drop` RX counter bumps once per
  dropped reassembly.

**Status:** locked in.

### §9 IP-in-IP tunnel ECN handling

**No test surface — not implemented.**

no consumer today; CE-erasure detection §8 is router-side).
